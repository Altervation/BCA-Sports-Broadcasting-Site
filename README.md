# BCA-Sports-Broadcasting-Site

Create a new website collaboratively for our athletics and perhaps competition teams, posting scores, players, interviews, highlights, achievements, and much more. Allows people to stay up-to-date on current sports events and promote school’s athletics spirit. 

Clear and high quality images, interesting videos, doesn’t glitch out easily.
Clean bookmarks tab, works on any device, url easy to type and remember, etc.
Cleanly incorporate different teams and score, content easy to update - perhaps automatic if optimal.

Be able to advertise website and allow multiple people to use it and be aware of it. Final goal is to have schools acknowledge and make official.
